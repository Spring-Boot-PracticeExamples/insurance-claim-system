# üõ°Ô∏è Insurance Claim Processing System

This is a **Spring Boot mini-project** that applies all **SOLID principles** using a real-world **Insurance Claim Processing** example. The system supports multiple claim types like `AUTO`, `HEALTH`, and `PROPERTY`.

## ‚úÖ SOLID Principles Applied

| Principle | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **S** ‚Äì Single Responsibility | Each class has a single job (e.g., `ClaimValidator`, `ClaimService`, `ClaimController`) |
| **O** ‚Äì Open/Closed | New claim types can be added without modifying existing logic |
| **L** ‚Äì Liskov Substitution | All processors implement the `ClaimProcessor` interface |
| **I** ‚Äì Interface Segregation | Focused interfaces like `ClaimProcessor` avoid unnecessary methods |
| **D** ‚Äì Dependency Inversion | `ClaimService` depends on `ClaimProcessor` abstraction, not implementation |

SOLID Principle	Related Class / Interface / Package	Explanation
S ‚Äì Single Responsibility	- ClaimValidator (validation package)
- ClaimService
- NotificationService
- ClaimProcessor implementations (AutoClaimProcessor, etc.)	Each class has one responsibility, e.g., validation, processing claims, sending notifications
  O ‚Äì Open/Closed	- ClaimProcessor interface
- ClaimProcessorFactory
- Concrete ClaimProcessor classes	New claim types can be added by creating new processors without modifying existing code
  L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution	- ClaimProcessor interface
- AutoClaimProcessor, HealthClaimProcessor, etc.	Subclasses implement the interface and can be substituted without breaking functionality
  I ‚Äì Interface Segregation	- ClaimProcessor interface	The interface is minimal and focused with only the necessary method(s)
  D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion	- ClaimService depends on ClaimProcessor abstraction
- ClaimProcessorFactory provides processors	High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
